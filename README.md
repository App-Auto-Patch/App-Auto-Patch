## Introduction
App Auto-Patch combines local application discovery, an Installomator integration, and user-friendly swiftDialog prompts to automate application patch management across Mac computers.

## Why Build This

App Auto-Patch was developed based on a similar concept as the Patchomator project, with a significant portion of its code borrowed from there. The main requirement for its use was to create a script deployable through Jamf Pro without the need for installing multiple dependencies on end-user computers. Since the original concept, it has since become an independent repository hosted here.

The script simplifies the process of taking an inventory of installed applications and patching them, eliminating the need for creating multiple Smart Groups, Policies, Patch Management Titles, etc., within Jamf Pro. It provides an easy solution for keeping end-users' applications updated with minimal effort.

This project has since been applied to MDMs outside of Jamf Pro, showcasing its versatility and adaptability.
